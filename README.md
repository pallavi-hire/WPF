## What is MVVM?
It is a style of WPF programming in which there are 3 main parts to the project:

    1- The "View" is the User interface. It consists of .xaml files

    2- The "Model" is the Data to be shown in the view or to be retrieved from the view. 

    3- The "ViewModel" which brings data from View to Model back and forth using binding.

    The ViewModel contains the state of the view and the operations on it.

Binding is setting data of the Model to the View and getting data from View into the model.

## To create a WPF MVMM Project:
- Create a WPF Project in the Visual Studio
- Check these References to be added to the project:
  
     **PresentationCore, PresentationFramework, WindowsBase**

### Create View
- Create (or use) your Main View (MainWindow.xaml) in the **Views folder**
  
### Create Model
- Create  a data model class in the  **Models Folder**:
```
class User
{
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
}
```
<a id="viewmodel"></a>
### Create ViewModel
ViewModel **Sends data from Model to View** by setting the value of a property and calling OnPropertyChanged, in its methods

ViewModel **Sends data from View to Model** by Getting the value from parameters of the RelayCommand and setting them to properties 

or by setting the DataContext of the view to the viewModel and binding a "property" of the view element to a property of the ViewModel
- Create a **ViewModelBase Class** in the  **ViewModels Folder**:

(It will be the parent of all ViewModel classes)
```
  public class ViewModelBase: INotifyPropertyChanged
    {
        public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;
        public void OnPropertyChanged(string property) =>
                     PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(property));
    }
```
The OnPropertyChanged method will be used in the "set" method of properties of ViewModel, to reflect changes:
```
 public class StudentVM: ViewModelBase
    {
        private Student _student;
        private ObservableCollection<Student> _students;
        public Student Student
        {
            get => _student;
            }
            set{
                _student = value;
                OnPropertyChanged("Student");
            }
        }
        public ObservableCollection<Student> Students
        {
            get =>return _students;
            
            set {
                _students = value;
                OnPropertyChanged("Students");
            }
        }

        public StudentVM(List<Student> students = null)
        {
            Student = new Student();
            if(students!=null)
            Students = new ObservableCollection<Student>(students);
            Students.CollectionChanged += new System.Collections.Specialized.NotifyCollectionChangedEventHandler(Students_CollectionChanged);
        }

        //Whenever a new item is added to the collection, am explicitly calling notify the property changed  
        void Students_CollectionChanged(object sender, System.Collections.Specialized.NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs e)
        {
            OnPropertyChanged("Students");
        }
...
```
As you can see, The **ObservableCollection** is used instead of the **List**.

ObservableCollection has a **CollectionChanged** event Handler to be able to notify the UI of any changes made to the collection.

<a id="Command"></a>
### Create Command (to use in VM for functionalities of events)
- Create a CommandClass like this:

  (It is just a class, implementing the **ICommand** interface)

```
 public class RelayCommand: ICommand
    {   
        private readonly Action<object> _execute;
        private readonly Predicate<object> _canExecute;

        public RelayCommand(Action<object> execute) : this(execute, null)
        {
        }
        public RelayCommand(Action<object> execute, Predicate<object> canExecute)
        {
            if (execute == null)
                throw new ArgumentNullException("execute");
            _execute = execute;
            _canExecute = canExecute;
        }
        public bool CanExecute(object parameter)
        {
            return _canExecute == null ? true : _canExecute(parameter);
        }
        public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged
        {
            add { CommandManager.RequerySuggested += value; }
            remove { CommandManager.RequerySuggested -= value; }
        }
        public void Execute(object parameter)
        {
            _execute(parameter);
        }
```
(canExecute parameter of the second constructor,is a condition. it is a boolean function which specifiy in which condition the command is enabled and can be executed)

- Add a Command to a ViewModel, like this:
  (Each of these ViewModels will be bound to a Window )
```
   public class LoginVM: ViewModelBase
    {
        private User user;
        public ICommand LoginCommand { get; }
        public LoginVM()
        {
            user = new User();
            LoginCommand = new RelayCommand((param) => LoggedIn(user.UserName,user.Password));
        }

        public string UserName
        {
            get => user.UserName;
            set
            {
                user.UserName = value;
                OnPropertyChanged(nameof(UserName));
            }
        }

        public string Password
        {
            get => user.Password;
            set
            {
                user.Password = value;
                OnPropertyChanged(nameof(Password));
            }
        }

        private void LoggedIn(object parameter1, object parameter2)
        {
        }
    }
  ```
Each Command in the ViewModel, Handles operations of the window events.

for example, you can write your login logic inside the LoggedIn method above.

<a id="Binding"></a>
### Bind the ViewModel to the View 
- Now you can bind the ViewModel to the view, Using DataContext :
  #### Binding in Xaml
  you can bind the VM to the view by setting the DataContext property of the view in C# or Xaml:
```
<UserControl.DataContext >
    <viewmodels: LoginVM />
</UserControl.DataContext>
```
and to show the bound value in a TextBox control.

for example, You can use the **Binding** keyword:
```
<TextBox  Text="{Binding UserName, Mode=TwoWay, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}" />
```
and bind the Buttons to Commands like this:

(as you see, you can pass a parameter to the command)
```
<Button x:Name="LoginBtn" Command="{Binding LoginCommand}">
   <Button.CommandParameter>
       "{Binding  UserName}"
       ,"{Binding  Password}"
   </Button.CommandParameter>
 </Button>
```
#### Binding in code:

In the "code behind" of the window:
```
public List<Student> Students { get; set; }

public MainWindow()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    List<Student> Students = new List<Student>();
    Students = new List<Student>
    {
        new Student("Dave", 20),
        new Student("Bill", 24),
        new Student("deri", 21))
    };
    DataContext = new StudentVM(Students);
}
```
and in the listView in the Xaml :
```
<ListView  ItemsSource="{Binding Students}">
     <ListView.View>
         <GridView>
             <GridViewColumn DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding Name}" Header="Name" />
             <GridViewColumn  DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding Age}" Header="Age" />
         </GridView>
     </ListView.View>
 </ListView>
```
